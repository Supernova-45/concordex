### `concordex map`
The `concordex map` command generates the cluster x cluster matrix where each entry is the fraction of cluster i's neighbors which are in cluster j (i, j are row, column indices into the matrix). The matrix can be generated by running 

```bash
concordex map -a assignments.txt -o map.csv mtx_file
```
This matrix can be used to visualize the concordex measure (in leiu of producing a non-linear 2-dimensional embedding).

### `concordex stat`
The `concordex stat` command generates the `concordex` statistic as described in [this manuscript]([url](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.28.546949)https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.28.546949). The stat can be generated by running

```bash
concordex stat -a assignments.txt -o map.csv mtx_file
```
